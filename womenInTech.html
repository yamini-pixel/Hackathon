              <p class="lead">
                Ada was the daughter of romantic poet, Lord Byron, and his wife,
                Anna Isabella-Byron. Her mathematical talent shone through in
                her early life, and her skills and interest in machines lead to
                a working relationship with Charles Babbage. Babbage was the
                inventor of the “Analytical Engine”, a complicated device that
                was never actually created, but resembled the elements of a
                modern computer. As a result of her work on the project, Ada is
                often referred to as the “world’s first computer programmer”. It
                was Lovelace's notes on the Analytical Engine that Alan Turing
                used as a form of inspiration for his work on the first modern
                computer in the 1940s.

              <p class="lead">
                Grace Hopper was born in 1906 and died in 1992, she was born in
                New York and attended Yale University in 1930 and eventually
                received a PH. D in mathematics. In 1943 she joined the Naval
                Reserve and retired in 1966. During the years as a Naval
                Reserve, Grace joined the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corp in 1949
                where she designed a compiler which translated programmer’s
                instructions into computer codes. In 1957, her division
                developed the first English language data processing complier.
                After retiring from the Naval Reserve, she was recalled helping
                standardise the navy’s computer languages and at the age of 79,
                she was known as the oldest officer in the navy before she
                retired in 1986. She has been given several awards, one of them
                being awarded by Barack Obama as the Presidential Medal of
                Freedom in 2016.

              <p class="lead">
                Adele was instrumental in the development of the programming
                language Smalltalk-80, which inspired the very first Apple
                computer. Adele is said to have referred to the decision to show
                Steve Jobs Smalltalk as a way to “give away the kitchen sink”.
                She was probably right! The concepts that Adele and her team set
                in motion became the basis for graphical user interfaces (GUI)
                we use every day.

                Between 1972 to 1989, Elizabeth ran the Network Information
                Center in California, which was a bit like a “pre-historic
                Google.” The NIC was the first place to publish the resources
                and directories for the Internet, developing the original "white
                pages" and “yellow pages” directories. Her group also developed
                the domain naming scheme of .com, .edu, .gov, .net, and many
                more that we use so commonly today.

                Karen was a pioneer in information science, and her work is some
                of the most highly cited in her field. Her development of
                Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), a weighting factor which
                evaluates how important a word is to a document, is now standard
                in web search engines and used to rank a document’s relevance to
                a search query. She received the highly acclaimed Lovelace Medal

                gap in the tech workforce, with programs for grades 3 all the
                way through college. The organization offers summer immersion
                and campus programs, online resources, books, after-school clubs
                and college alumni programs. To date, the organization has
                served more than 450,000 girls, approximately half of whom are
                from underserved communities made up of Black, Latina and
                low-income girls. In 2017, Saujani published her book, Girls Who
                Code: Learn to Code and Change the World, promoting the tenets
                of her organization.
